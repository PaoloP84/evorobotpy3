# evorobotpy3
Evorobotpy3 is a flexible and easy-to-use simulation tool allowing users to implement and test algorithms. The tool provides a list of benchmark problems like classic control, robot locomotion, swarm robotics, competitive co-evolution and others. Evorobotpy3 contains a lot algorithms ranging from classic Evolutionary Algorithms (EvoStick, Generational Genetic Algorithm, Hill-Climbing, Steady-State) to modern Evolutionary Strategies (CMA-ES, OpenAI-ES, sNES, xNES), and supports the use of RL methods like PPO. In addition, the users can define controllers through different types of neural networks (feed-forward, recurrent, LSTM).

One of the most import features of evorobotpy3 is its usability: users can run experiments by specifying all the parameters in a configuration file (see file config.ini in the homepage of the repo).

Evorobotpy3 has been presented during the 2025 Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO 2025).

The authors want to thank Pedro Neves for his contribution, particularly with respect to the implementation of the Double T-Maze environment.
