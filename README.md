# evorobotpy3
A tool for training robots through evolutionary and reinforcement learning methods. It contains a lot of algorithms, including OpenAI-ES, CMA-ES, xNES and others. A lot new tasks have been added, ranging from classic control (i.e., double-pole balancing) to swarm robotics up to Box2D tasks (i.e., the 2D versions of the Halfcheetah pybullet locomotor). The tool is integrated with widely used libraries like stable-baselines (for RL algorithms like PPO), gymnasium and others. Users can easily run experiments with gymnasium tasks (for example, pybullet locomotors or classic control).

The tool is documented in [How to Train Robots through Evolutionary and Reinforcement Learning Methods](https://bacrobotics.com/Chapter13.html) which includes also a detailed tutorial with excercises.

For an introduction to the theory and to state-of-the-art research in this areas, see the associated open-access book [Behavioral and Cognitive Robotics: An Adaptive Perspective](https://bacrobotics.com).
